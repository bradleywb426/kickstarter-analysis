# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Analyzing data from US-based campagins of Kickstarters for plays to uncover trends in successful and failed campaigns

## Overview
Louise just finished her Kickstarter campaign for her play, *Fever*. Now, she wants comparisons on other Kickstarter campaigns for plays and their outcomes. To accomplish this, we have looked through a dataset of Kickstarter campaigns and filtered to look at other plays, and then analyzed their outcomes based on their campaign launch date and their funding goal. 






## Analysis and Challanges
Explain how you performed your analysis using images and links to code, as well as any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them. If you had no challenges, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered.
### Analysis of Outcomes based on Launch Date
Looking at the outcomes of the campaigns based on Launch Date, we can see that the failure rate follows the same general pattern as the success rate. The time of the largest difference in failure rates and success rates is from the Late Spring to Summer. This corresponds with May to August, and the most successful months are May and June.

### Analysis of Outcomes based on Goals

## Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?


## Breakdown of Campaign Outcomes based on Category

Looking at the breakdown of Kickstarter campaign outcomes in the US, we can see that "Theater" is the most numerous category with over 900 entries (912 to be exact). Subsequently, "Theater" also has the most successes and failures with over 500 successful campaigns and over 300 failed campaigns (specifically 525 and 349 respectfully). 

![Subcategory Outcomes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72563705/171234265-c14180f4-c064-4ea3-b69d-c07cee4135ac.png)
Furthering our view into the Subcategories of "Theater" we can see that "Plays" are the most numerous, with almost 700 different campaigns. "Plays" also had the highest success rate of the subcategories with around 400 successes (412 successes) and about 60% success rate (61.4% to be exact).

## Breakdown of Campaign Outcomes based on Launch Date

Looking at the outcomes of the campaigns based on Launch Date, we can see that the failure rate follows the same general pattern as the success rate. The time of the largest difference in failure rates and success rates is from the Late Spring to Summer. This corresponds with May to August, and the most successful months are May and June.

## Statistics of Goals and Pledges

These Box and Whisker Plots showcase the statistics of the Successful and Failed Play Kickstarters in the US. The goal of $10000 is above the highest value of the upper range of Successful Campaigns, but is almost the mean value of goals for Failed Campaigns. Looking at the same type of plot applied to the Pledges of Successful and Failed Play Kickstarters in the US tells a similar story.

The Pledges for Successful campaigns has the same shape of spread as the Goals, though the range is shifted towards higher values. 

## Recommendations
Based on the previous analyses, it is recommeneded that Fever's Kickstarter campaign is launched in the late Spring (April to May) with a Goal of less than $8500, which is the highest value pledged to campaigns similar to Fever's in the US.
