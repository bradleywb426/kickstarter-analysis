Looking at the breakdown of Kickstarter campaign outcomes in the US, we can see that "Theater" is the most numerous category with over 900 entries. Subsequently, "Theater" also has the most successes and failures with over 500 successful campaigns and over 300 failed campaigns.

Furthering our view into the Subcategories of "Theater" we can see that "Plays" are the most numerous, with almost 700 different campaigns. "Plays" also had the highest success rate of the subcategories with around 400 successes and about 60% success rate.

Looking at the outcomes of the campaigns based on Launch Date, we can see that the failure rate follows the same general pattern as the success rate. The time of the largest difference in failure rates and success rates is in the Spring, particularly the Late Spring.

## Statistics of Goals and Pledges

These Box and Whisker Plots showcase the statistics of the Successful and Failed Play Kickstarters in the US. The goal of $10000 is above the highest value of the upper range of Successful Campaigns, but is almost the mean value of goals for Failed Campaigns. Looking at the same type of plot applied to the Pledges of Successful and Failed Play Kickstarters in the US tells a similar story.

The Pledges for Successful campaigns has the same shape of spread as the Goals, though the range is shifted towards higher values. 

## Recommendations
Based on the previous analyses, it is recommeneded that Fever's Kickstarter campaign is launched in the late Spring (April to May) with a Goal of less than $8500, which is the highest value pledged to campaigns similar to Fever's in the US.
